# react-from-base

React from base template [NOT FOR PRODUCTION]

## What is this?

This is a barebones React template that uses the CDN links for React and ReactDOM. Just a single HTML running react without any build tools.

## Why?

I wanted to see how much smaller the React bundle size is when using the CDN links. I also wanted to see how much smaller the bundle size is when using the CDN links and not using a bundler.

## How to use

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npx live-server` in the root directory
